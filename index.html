  <h1 style="color: green;">The birth of the legend</h1>
  <h2 style="color:red;">8th June 2005</h2>
  <p>It was a rainy night. Lightning's lights and roar of thunder filled the sky. The cry of the baby boy was heard all over the village. The mom knew that her child was truly the chosen one. The dad caressing his wife knew that whoever she had brought into this world was extraordinary. The villagers listening to his cry hated to admit that *a hero has been born*. The foretellers, witchdoctors, and everyone blessed with the gift of foreseeing the future knew that **a legend is born**.</p>
